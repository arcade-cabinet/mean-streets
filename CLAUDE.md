# Mean Streets — Agent Instructions

## What This Is

A gritty tactical single-lane turf war card game. v0.3 design: you and
your opponent each defend ONE active turf at a time; reserves queue
behind. When your active turf falls, the next reserve promotes up —
best of N where N is the difficulty's turf count. Stack-based combat,
HP + damage tiers, heat + raids, Black Market + Holding, 10
hand-authored mythics. No dice.

**Doc pillars** — each file owns exactly one area:
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — vision, identity, philosophy, pivot history
- `docs/RULES.md` — authoritative gameplay mechanics (single-lane, HP,
  heat, market, holding, mythics, damage tiers, progression)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — technical stack, directory layout, data flow
- `docs/PRODUCTION.md` — release readiness, platform targets, blockers
- `docs/VISUAL_REVIEW.md` — how to run and review visual fixtures

Archived: `docs/archive/RULES-v0.2.md` for prior design reference.

## Critical Rules

1. **The game design is LOCKED IN.** `docs/RULES.md` v0.3 is the
   authoritative source of truth for mechanics — do not reinvent them.
   Release status tracks in `docs/PRODUCTION.md`.
2. **Balance is simulation-proven.** Any rule change must be validated
   with `pnpm run analysis:benchmark` before committing. Changes to
   `src/sim/turf/**` that shift thresholds must update
   `src/data/ai/turf-sim.json` (not hardcoded constants).
3. **No dice, no coin flip.** Outcomes are deterministic. Only
   randomness is deck draw order, seeded rarity rolls at pack open,
   seeded AI noise, and seeded bribe probabilistic rolls.
4. **The simulation engine runs WITHOUT React.** Pure TypeScript,
   testable independently.
5. **pnpm only.** Do not create `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
   Use `pnpm` for every install/run.
6. **Biome, not ESLint.** `pnpm run lint` runs Biome.
7. **Single-lane engagement.** Only turfs[0] is active per side; all
   strikes, plays, retreats, etc. operate there. Reserves are shown
   as indicators but are not interactable until promoted.

## Commands

## Project Structure (v0.3)

### Sim engine — `src/sim/turf/`
- `types.ts` — Card/StackedCard/Turf/PlayerState/CardInstance/
  ToughInCustody/WarStats + heat/blackMarket/holding/lockup/
  mythicPool state on TurfGameState

## Key Types (v0.3)

- `Rarity` — `'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'legendary' | 'mythic'`
- `Card` — Discriminated union on `kind`:
  `ToughCard | WeaponCard | DrugCard | CurrencyCard`
- `ToughCard` — `{ kind: 'tough', id, name, tagline, archetype,
  affiliation, power, resistance, hp, maxHp, rarity, abilities[] }`
  (note: hp/maxHp added in v0.3; default hp=maxHp=resistance at compile)
- `StackedCard` — `{ card: Card; faceUp: boolean; owner?: string }`
  (owner = tough id equipping this modifier)
- `Turf` — `{ id, stack: StackedCard[], closedRanks, rivalBufferSpent?,
  isActive, reserveIndex }`
- `PlayerState` — `{ turfs: Turf[], deck, discard, toughsInPlay,
  actionsRemaining, pending, queued, turnEnded }` (no hand)
- `CardInstance` — `{ cardId, rolledRarity, unlockDifficulty }` —
  the collection unit
- `TurfGameState` — adds `heat`, `blackMarket`, `holding`, `lockup`,
  `mythicPool`, `mythicAssignments`, `warStats`, `phase: 'action' | 'resolve'`
- `TurfAction` — adds `stackIdx`, `toughId`, `targetToughId`,
  `offeredMods`, `targetRarity`, `healTarget`
- `TurfActionKind` — adds `modifier_swap`, `send_to_market`,
  `send_to_holding`, `black_market_trade`, `black_market_heal`
- `positionPower(turf)` — respects HP clamp on wounded toughs
- `positionResistance(turf)` — respects HP clamp
- `stepAction(state, action)` — single entry point for all mutations
- `createMatch(config, opts?) → MatchState` / `runTurn(match, actions)`
  / `isGameOver(match)`

## Testing Conventions

- `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` — Node environment (pure logic, sim, ECS)
- `*.dom.test.tsx` — jsdom for presentational components. **Do not**
  import anything that touches Capacitor, jeep-sqlite, or real browser
  APIs here — move those to `.browser.test.tsx`.
- `*.browser.test.tsx` — Real Chromium via `@vitest/browser-playwright`.
  Use `renderInBrowser` from `src/test/render-browser.tsx`; sets
  `window.__MEAN_STREETS_TEST__ = true` so `AppShellProvider` skips
  native shell configuration.
- `e2e/*.spec.ts` — Playwright end-to-end against the dev server
  (configured in `playwright.config.ts`; runs desktop-chromium,
  iphone-14, pixel-7, ipad-pro-landscape projects). **E2E is NOT in
  PR CI** — it runs in `cd.yml` on push to main (gates deploy) and
  on-demand locally via `pnpm run test:e2e`. Run locally before
  merging large UI changes.
- Integration smoke scaffold: `src/sim/turf/__tests__/v03-integration.test.ts`
  — active test suite.

## Known Gaps (post-v1.0.0)

- AI's pre-war collection curation (`curator.ts`) is active but simple;
  heuristics may benefit from tuning via simulation post-launch.
- Mythic balance must be paper-playtested individually — simulation
  can't tune game-warping signature abilities the same way it tunes
  common stats.
- Mythic art is geometric SVG placeholders — editorial illustration
  pass is a post-1.0 polish task.

## Release Status

v1.0.0 shipped 2026-04-18. See `docs/PRODUCTION.md` for post-1.0 polish
items. Paper playtests: `docs/plans/v0.3-paper-playtest.md` +
`v0.3-paper-playtest-2.md`.
